## ... so far:

-   Block I: Import, Tidy, Transform, & Visualize Data

-   Block II: Communicate & Collaborate

![](workflow.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Block III: Web scraping

➡️ Today and next week: Back to communicating our results (Block II), but in an **interactive** way!

## Plan for today

```{r, include=FALSE}
pacman::p_load("tidyverse")
```

**Short input**

-   Using dashboards

-   A short introduction to shiny (dashboards)

-   Next week: Reactivity & themes

**Coding**

-   Applied examples

-   Your first shiny app!

## Dashboards

-   Dashboards represent a tool for effective data visualization

-   They allow us to communicate information as intuitively as possible and can support data-driven decision making

-   We focus presenting our *results* and telling a story!

-   Dashboards are useful for science communication but also provide added value in other areas such as consulting, business, etc.

## Dashboard - Covid

... but of course many other applications! GovTech, Finance, Marketing, ...

# Shiny apps

## Why Shiny apps?

Most importantly:

-   (Interactive) communication of scientific results

-   (Interactive) visualization of data sets

But there are many more use cases!

## Shiny apps in your final project

## Shiny apps can also look like this:

# But let's start with the basics!

## Key elements of a Shiny app

-   UI (user interface):

    -   Here, we can determine the "look" of our app.

-   Server:

    -   Here, we define our functions

-   shinyApp():

    -   Combines our UI and server parts.

## bslib

## How to assemble these elements

::: panel-tabset
## set up

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(bslib)
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

data <- gapminder
```

## ui

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
ui <- page_sidebar(
  title = "Life expectancy around the world",
  sidebar = sidebar(
    selectInput(
      inputId = "continent", 
      label = "Choose a continent", 
      choices = c("Europe",
                  "Africa",
                  "Americas",
                  "Oceania"), 
      selected = "Europe"
    )
  ),
  
  plotOutput("histogram")
)
```

## server

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$histogram <- renderPlot({
    
    data %>% 
      filter(continent == input$continent) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = lifeExp),
                     binwidth = 5,
                     boundary = 0) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(y = "Count",
           x = "Life Expectancy")
  })
}
```

## shinyApp()

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Output

## Building your own app

::: panel-tabset
## Get started

-   There are many great resources online. I recommend starting with the R Shiny documentation on how to get started and to build your own app:

    -   https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html

-   In addition, the *Mastering Shiny* book by Hadley Wickham is great!

    -   https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html

## Customize

## Widgets

## How to publish your app

-   There are many ways. I find *shinyapps.io* the easiest.

    -   Set up a free account at *shinyapps.io*

-   Follow only a few steps in this [short tutorial](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/share/shinyapps/). It includes:

    -   Installing and loading the rsconnect package

    -   Add your token from your shinyapps.io account to the rsconnect package once

    -   Deploy your app via the *Publish* button while viewing the app

# Applied example

## Your turn!

-   Take some time to understand and run the R scripts provided on ILIAS or access the via the links on the course website.

-   Now, apply it to different data! Always a simple start: Gapminder.

-   Also: Try out different widgets. For example, a slider. When using a slider, you need a continuous variable!

-   If you have time left, set up a free account at *shinyapps.io* and try to publish your first Shiny app (dashboard) online.
