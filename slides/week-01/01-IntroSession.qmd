## Plan & expectations

-   We are a small group. Great!

-   Mix of lecture-style input, live coding, group exercises, and discussion.

-   Small group also means: Active participation in class and preparation

-   Willingness to invest time to learn a (new) programming language, look for solutions on your own, and keep trying

## Organisation & Resources

-   Materials will be provided via the course website.

-   Communication via ILIAS. Make sure that you have access to the course on ILIAS and that emails that are sent over ILIAS are forwarded to the email account you check regularly

-   Weekly office hours after the course. Please make an appointment via e-mail.

## Course requirements

-   Active participation & preparation

-   Two short, individual assignments during the semester (10% of your grade)

-   Data project (90% of your grade)

    -   See syllabus! But also more on this during the semester.
    
## Shiny apps in your final project

## Illness (& Covid)

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

## Disabilities

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the appropriate arrangements immediately.

## Support

-   Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable with the question. It is important to note that the **University's Equality and Diversity Office** supports and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The responsible contact person in such a case is **Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfr√ºnder**. She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything strictly confidential.
