# To Do's before our session

Read [Chapter 24 "Webscraping" in R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping). This helps to review our learnings from last session and prepares you for today's session on static webscraping.

How can you apply these new skills to your ideas for the data project?

By the way, the "book" R for Data Science which is available online is built with Quarto!
